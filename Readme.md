Specs2wsxm
==========

Specs2WSXM is an Igor PRO procedure written in Igor 6.12A. 

This GUI application is designed to quickly load and visualize the contents of 
.mul, .flm and .miv files acquired using SpecsProbe.exe, 
an acquisition software developed for SPM 150 Aarhus, the STM setup originally 
designed by Professors Flemming Besenbacher, Erik LÃ¦gsgaard, and Ivan Stensgaard 
at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. This STM design is being exclusively produced 
and marketed by SPECS GmbH.

The code also contains functions to convert the contents of .mul, .flm and .miv files
into separated images and point scans (like IV curves) with the file format of 
nanotec [WSXM](http://www.wsxmsolutions.com/) program (www.nanotec.es).
